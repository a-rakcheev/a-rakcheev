### :bust_in_silhouette: About
Hi, I am a computational quantum physicist doing data science.


I did my PhD and worked as a postdoc in the [group of Andreas LÃ¤uchli](https://www.psi.ch/en/ltc/computergestutzte-physik) at the Paul Scherrer Institute and the University of Innsbruck.
During that time, I wrote code for the simulation of quantum dynamics; mostly in Python using NumPy, SciPy, Numba, and Matplotlib.
After that, I completed a three-month full-time intensive Data Science Bootcamp at [Constructor Academy in ZÃ¼rich](https://academy.constructor.org/data-science/zurich). 

My research code, along with code I wrote during the bootcamp, will be available in various repos. After work, I love playing :basketball: and listening to podcasts.
