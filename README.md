### :bust_in_silhouette: About
Hi, I am a computational quantum physicist doing data science.

Currently, I take part in a three-month full-time Data Science Bootcamp at [Constructor Academy in ZÃ¼rich](https://academy.constructor.org/data-science/zurich).
Before that, I did my PhD and worked as a postdoc in the [group of Andreas LÃ¤uchli](https://www.psi.ch/en/ltc/computergestutzte-physik) at the Paul Scherrer Institute and the University of Innsbruck. 

During that time, I wrote code for the simulation of quantum dynamics; mostly in Python using NumPy, SciPy, Numba, and Matplotlib. This code, along with code I wrote during the bootcamp, will be available in various repos. After work, I love listening to podcasts and playing :basketball:.
